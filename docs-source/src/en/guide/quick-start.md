# Quick Start

> Integrate `Hikage` into your project.

## Project Requirements

The project needs to be created using `Android Studio` or `IntelliJ IDEA` and must be an Android or Kotlin Multiplatform
project with integrated Kotlin environment dependencies.

- Android Studio (It is recommended to get the latest version from [here](https://developer.android.com/studio))

- IntelliJ IDEA (It is recommended to get the latest version from [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea))

- Kotlin 1.9.0+, Gradle 8+, Java 17+, Android Gradle Plugin 8+

### Configure Repositories

The dependencies of `Hikage` are published in **Maven Central** and our public repository,
you can use the following method to configure repositories.

We recommend using Kotlin DSL as the Gradle build script language.

Configure dependency in your project's `build.gradle.kts`.

```kotlin
repositories {
    google()
    mavenCentral()
    // (Optional) You can add this URL to use our public repository
    // When Sonatype-OSS fails and cannot publish dependencies, this repository is added as a backup
    // For details, please visit: https://github.com/HighCapable/maven-repository
    maven("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HighCapable/maven-repository/main/repository/releases")
}
```

### Configure Java Version

Modify the Java version of Kotlin in your project's `build.gradle.kts` to 17 or above.

> Kotlin DSL

```kotlin
android {
    compileOptions {
        sourceCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_17
        targetCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_17
    }
}

tasks.withType<KotlinJvmCompile>().configureEach {
    compilerOptions {
        jvmTarget.set(JvmTarget.JVM_17)
    }
}
```
